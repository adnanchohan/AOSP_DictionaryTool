Steps to produce Dictionary file (.dict)

Assumptions:

1) Lets assume you have a text file full of raw data that are excluded from special characters and numbers.

Steps to Make Dictionary:

1. Open the project in Pycharm or any other IDE.
2. Browse for "check_frequency_generate_db.py" Open it and in the last line main method is taking filepath as input: Put file path of your "raw_data.txt" file and run it.
3. It Generates a sqlite database "EnglishDictionary.sqlite", Open it in Sqlite Browser and export the data as ".csv" file (while exporting put "|" as the separater instead of ",").
4. When a csv file is generated, open it inside any text editor lets say in sublime text and replace “ | ” with “ , f=”.
5. Save as file in different extension (rawdata.csv to rawdata.combined).
6. After that, Open the new (.combined) file in any text editor, Now remove the first line ("word, freq") & Add a header e.g: dictionary=main:en,locale=en,description=English,date=1542212847,version=01.
7. Run the following: java -jar dicttool_aosp.jar makedict -s main_en.combined -d main_en.dict

Note: .jet and .dict files are dictionary files, only difference is .jet files are the compressed form of .dict file
